# Auto Refresh 1/5/15 Min Chrome Extensions

These three extensions will refresh the current tab automatically after their specified time. If you are using a Google Slide for digital signage, the tab needs to reload for it to pick up the changes. Using one of these extensions will do that for you automatically, no configuration is necessary. This allows you to push the extension out in Google Admin.
